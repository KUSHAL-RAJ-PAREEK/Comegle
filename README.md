## 🏫 College-Only Access

- Users **must sign in with their official college email address** (e.g., `student@abc.edu`).
- Email domains are verified to match against a pre-approved list.
- Users are only matched with other students from the **same college domain**.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Sign In**  
   - Users log in via OAuth using Google through **NextAuth.js**.  

2. **Room Allocation**  
   - A Redis-backed queue system allocates rooms by grouping users from the same college.  
   - The matching algorithm ensures quick and relevant pairings.

3. **Video & Chat Communication**  
   - **WebRTC** + **PeerJS** are used for peer-to-peer video calling.  
   - **Socket.IO** handles signaling, events (join, next, stop), and chat messages.
